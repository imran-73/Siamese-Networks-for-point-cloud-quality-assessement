# Siamese Networks for point cloud quality assessment 

A sample code code from my internship work. 

The jupyter notebook src/Siamese_networks_for_quality_assessment_on_ICIP_dataset.ipynb shows the implementation and test on ICIP 2020 dataset of siamese networks for point cloud full-reference quality assessment.

The ICIP 2020 dataset can be dowloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MemLa255e0wrGXbWoVKDS5ghoqAmfWHw/view?usp=sharing

Some preprocessing functions used in this project (in src/utilities.py file) were taken from the Maurice Quach repository https://github.com/mauriceqch/2021_pc_perceptual_loss. These parts of code were highlighted by the comment : ### Quach
